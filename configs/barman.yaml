domain_intro: |
      I am a barman who manipulates drink dispensers, shots and a shaker to serve a desired set of drinks. Shots and shakers are types of containers. Ingredients and cocktails are types of beverages.
      Here are the actions I can do

      Leave a container on the table
      Fill a shot
      Refill a shot
      Empty a shot

      Pour contents of a shot into a clean shaker
      Pour contents of a shot into a used shaker
      Empty a shaker
